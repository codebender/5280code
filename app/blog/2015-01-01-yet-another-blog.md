### Starting Again
I'm going to start blogging again about Tech N' Stuff.  I used to write blogs
very sporadically on [BentSolutions.com](http://www.bentsolutions.com/blog) but
now I really want to start blogging more consistently. Perhaps as often as once
a week...(findgers crossed)


### Who is the developer Matthew Bender?
I'm a true Ruby on Rails nerd! In the past, I was a C# .NET zombie but 4 years
ago I joined and have enjoyed working with the ruby open source community. More
recently, I've been working a lot with Rails RESTful APIs and AngularJS
front-ends. I enjoy developing with the TDD methodology. As a lead engineer, I
am passionate in improving those around me. I attend conferences, go to
meet-ups, read blogs, and listen to podcasts, always trying to bring interesting
and new ideas to my team. I am now exploring more programming languages for
cases when certain technologies can help scale an application. I most interested
in Node.js, Elixir, and Go. I have also dabbled in R and started learning the
value of data science.

### What is 5280code.com?
This website is really just a sandbox/playground for me to implement whatever I
want when I have a free moment and not just have the code live in a git repo
somewhere.

### More to Come
I'll create blog posts explaining the individual parts of this website

1. Fitbit device data Integration
2. Bitcoin & Pusher price Integration
3. Meetup.com events Integration
4. Blog Engine
